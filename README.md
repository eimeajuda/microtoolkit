Micro is a **microservice** toolkit. Its purpose is to simplify distributed systems development.

Check out [**go-micro**](https://github.com/micro/go-micro) if you want to start writing services in Go now. Examples of how to write services in other languages can be found in [examples/greeter](https://github.com/micro/micro/tree/master/examples/greeter).

Learn more about Micro in the introductory blog post [https://blog.micro.mu/2016/03/20/micro.html](https://blog.micro.mu/2016/03/20/micro.html) or watch the talk from the [Golang UK Conf 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xspaDovwk34).

# Overview
The goal of **Micro** is to simplify distributed systems development. At the core micro should be accessible enough to anyone who wants to get started writing microservices. As you scale to hundreds of services, micro will provide the necessary tooling to manage a microservice environment.
